# cryptoapp

This readme is an introduction of a project I am currently building: a cryptocurrency application which allows real time monitoring and predicive capabilities.

Each file has it's individual purpose. For example, alerttracking enables a user to receive notifications when a price is above (below) a certain threshold. Note: this project is a work-in-progress. As you will observe, classes are not defined yet, however, the API calls have been build including simple feedback. 

Objectives for in the future: 
(1) Apply ML algorithms towards predicting macro behavior (e.g. crypto winters),  
(2) Deploying NLP towards idenifying market sentiment, and 
(3) Building a user-friendly interface which allows these functionalities to be accessed.

More to follow soon :)
