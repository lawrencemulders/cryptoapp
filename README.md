# cryptoapp

This readme is an introduction to a project currently being build: a notification application which generates a weekly email providing a summary of stock/crypto performances. To keep costs at zero, no database is implemented and a local csv file is used to iterate and monitor progress.

Thus far APIs have been build for crypto. Soon APIs will follow for stocks and the iterative capability to update a local csv file.

Aspirations for the future:
(1) Apply NLP models to determine a sentiment scores per stock/crypto
(2) Creating abn interface which allows the user to provide the path directory of the csv file
(3) Creating a config file for the user

More to follow :)
